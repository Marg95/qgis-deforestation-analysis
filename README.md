# Deforestation Analysis

The province of Santiago del Estero recorded the highest rate of deforestation in the region during 2007-2008 (Ginzburg and Torrella, 2022), a period in which provincial law 6,942 on land use planning was enacted. This instrument classifies native forest areas into conservation categories. However, the process of deforestation continues to this day. The province also has a high percentage of unmet basic needs (UBN) and a large proportion of the rural population that lives in and depends on the forests. The Moreno department, in particular, has one of the largest areas of deforested land in the province (Aguiar et al., 2016; Schmidt et al., 2022). This study analyze deforestation and the socioeconomic situation, represented by the percentage of the population with IBPs, in relation to the categories of native forest established in the OTBN for the department of Moreno.

## Tools and Technologies

- QGIS 3.40
- High-resolution global maps of 21stcentury forest cover change (https://data.globalforestwatch.org/documents/52d6787146ee47b8b742f3e99a3a2276/about)
- OTBN shape file

## Results

According to the information analyzed, the Moreno department has 29 census tracts and a total population of 32,130 inhabitants. With regard to the OTBN, no category I (red) areas were recorded (Fig. 1). Category II (yellow) is home to 8,004 inhabitants and category III (green) to 372. The average NBI is 28.62%, with values ranging from 8.45% to 67.44%. The deforested area covers 186,661 hectares in category II and 61,182 hectares in category III.

## Conclusions

Although National Law 26,331 represents a significant advance in environmental legislation (Ginzburg and Torrella, 2022), it is essential to strengthen monitoring, controls, and sanctions for non-compliance. The results suggest that there is a relationship between conditions of social inequality and the intensification of natural resource exploitation, which translates into the loss of large areas of native forests, habitat, and sustenance for local populations and indigenous communities.
More in-depth analyses are needed that include information on land tenure and foreign capital.
